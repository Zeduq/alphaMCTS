Task Description:
There is an alpha factor used in quantitative investment to predict asset price trends. Please improve it according to the following suggestions and provide the improved alpha expression.

Available Data Fields:

The following data fields are available for use: {available_fields}

Available Operators:

The following operators are available for use: {available_operators}

Alpha Suggestions:

The alpha value should be dimensionless (unitless).

All look-back windows and other numerical parameters used in the alpha calculation MUST be represented as named parameters in the pseudo-code. These parameter names MUST follow Python naming conventions (e.g., lookback_period, volatility_window, smoothing_factor).

The alpha should have NO MORE than 3 parameters in total.

The pseudo-code should represent the alpha calculation step-by-step, using only the "Available Operators" and clearly defined parameters. Each line in the pseudo-code should represent a single operation.

Use descriptive variable names in the pseudo-code that clearly indicate the data they represent.

When designing alpha expressions, try to avoid including the following sub-expressions: {freq_subtrees}

Original alpha expression:
{origin_alpha_formula}

Refinement suggestions:
NOTE: The following improvement suggestions do not need to be all adopted; they just need to be considered and reasonable ones selected for adoption.
{refinement_suggestions}

Formatting Requirements:
The output must be in JSON format with three key-value pairs:

"name": A short, descriptive name for the alpha (following Python variable naming style, e.g., price_volatility_ratio).

"description": A concise explanation of the alpha's purpose or what it measures. Avoid overly technical language. Focus on the intuition behind the alpha.

"pseudo_code": A list of strings, where each string is a line of simplified pseudo-code representing a single operation in the alpha calculation. Each line should follow the format: variable_name = op_name(input=[input1, input2, ...], param=[param1, param2, ...]), where:

variable_name is the output variable of the operation.

op_name is the name of one of the "Available Operators".

input1, input2, ... are input variables (either from "Available Data Fields" or previously calculated variables, cannot be of a numeric type).

param1, param2, ... are parameter names defined in the alpha requirements.

The format example is as follows:
{{
"name": "volatility_adjusted_momentum",
"description": "...",
"pseudo_code": [......]
}}
