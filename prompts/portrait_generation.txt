Task Description:
You are a quantitative finance expert specializing in factor-based investing. Please design a new, original alpha factor for an investment strategy based on the available data and operators.

Available Data Fields:

The following data fields are available for use: {available_fields}

Available Operators:

The following operators are available for use: {available_operators}

Alpha Requirements:

The alpha value should be dimensionless (unitless).

The alpha should incorporate at least two distinct operations from the "Available Operators" list to ensure it has sufficient complexity. Avoid creating overly simplistic alphas.

All look-back windows and other numerical parameters used in the alpha calculation MUST be represented as named parameters in the pseudo-code. These parameter names MUST follow Python naming conventions (e.g., lookback_period, volatility_window, smoothing_factor).

The alpha should have NO MORE than 3 parameters in total.

The pseudo-code should represent the alpha calculation step-by-step, using only the "Available Operators" and clearly defined parameters. Each line in the pseudo-code should represent a single operation.

Use descriptive variable names in the pseudo-code that clearly indicate the data they represent.

When designing alpha expressions, try to avoid including the following sub-expressions:
{freq_subtrees}

Formatting Requirements:
The output must be in JSON format with three key-value pairs:

"name": A short, descriptive name for the alpha (following Python variable naming style, e.g., price_volatility_ratio).

"description": A concise explanation of the alpha's purpose or what it measures. Avoid overly technical language. Focus on the intuition behind the alpha.

"pseudo_code": A list of strings, where each string is a line of simplified pseudo-code representing a single operation in the alpha calculation. Each line should follow the format: variable_name = op_name(input=[input1, input2, ...], param=[param1, param2, ...]), where:

variable_name is the output variable of the operation.

op_name is the name of one of the "Available Operators".

input1, input2, ... are input variables (either from "Available Data Fields" or previously calculated variables, cannot be of a numeric type).

param1, param2, ... are parameter names defined in the alpha requirements.

The format example is as follows:
{{
"name": "volatility_adjusted_momentum",
"description": "This factor measures price momentum, adjusted for recent volatility.",
"pseudo_code": [
"price_range = subtract(input=[high, low])",
"momentum = ts_delta(input=[close], param=[momentum_period])",
"adjusted_momentum = divide(input=[momentum, price_range])"
]
}}
